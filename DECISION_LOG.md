# Technical Decision Log

This document records the key architectural and design decisions made during the development of the Task Manager API, along with the rationale behind each choice.

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Clean Architecture Implementation
**Decision**: Implemented Clean Architecture with dependency inversion
**Rationale**: 
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Changes in external systems don't affect core business logic
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations without changing business rules

**Layer Structure**:
- `domain/`: Contains business entities, rules, and abstract repository interfaces
- `application/`: Implements use cases and orchestrates business operations
- `infrastructure/`: Concrete implementations of external dependencies
- `presentation/`: API layer that handles user requests and responses

### 2. Dual API Strategy (REST + GraphQL)
**Decision**: Implement both REST and GraphQL APIs
**Rationale**:
- Although the challenge specified REST, recruiter suggested also implementing GraphQL
- **Flexibility**: Different clients can choose the most appropriate API style
- **Learning Demonstration**: Shows ability to work with multiple API paradigms
- **Use Case Optimization**: REST for simple CRUD, GraphQL for complex data fetching

### 3. Repository Pattern Implementation
**Decision**: Implement Repository Pattern for data access abstraction
**Rationale**:
- **Abstraction**: Isolates business logic from data access concerns
- **Testability**: Easy to mock repositories for unit testing
- **Consistency**: Uniform interface for all data operations
- **Flexibility**: Can switch between different data sources without changing business logic

### 4. Dependency Injection Pattern
**Decision**: Use dependency injection throughout the application
**Rationale**:
- **Loose Coupling**: Components depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Testing**: Easy to inject mock dependencies for testing
- **Configuration**: Runtime configuration of dependencies
- **SOLID Principles**: Follows Dependency Inversion Principle

## Design Patterns

### 5. Service Layer Pattern
**Decision**: Implement service layer for business operations
**Rationale**:
- **Business Logic Centralization**: All use cases are implemented in service classes
- **Transaction Management**: Services handle transaction boundaries
- **Reusability**: Services can be used by both REST and GraphQL presentations
- **Separation**: Clear distinction between presentation and business logic

### 6. DTO (Data Transfer Object) Pattern
**Decision**: Use DTOs for API request/response handling
**Rationale**:
- **API Contract**: Clear definition of what data is expected/returned
- **Validation**: Input validation at the API boundary
- **Versioning**: Easy to evolve API without changing domain models
- **Security**: Only expose necessary data to clients

### 7. Factory Pattern for Service Creation
**Decision**: Implement factory pattern for service instantiation
**Rationale**:
- **Dependency Management**: Centralized creation of service dependencies
- **Configuration**: Single place to configure service dependencies
- **Testing**: Easy to override service creation for tests
- **Consistency**: Ensures all services are created with proper dependencies

## Data Design Patterns

### 8. Value Object Pattern for Enums
**Decision**: Use domain-driven value objects for task status and priority
**Rationale**:
- **Type Safety**: Prevents invalid state assignments
- **Domain Modeling**: Accurately represents business concepts
- **Immutability**: Status and priority values cannot be accidentally modified
- **Validation**: Business rules are enforced at the domain level

### 9. Computed Properties Pattern
**Decision**: Calculate completion percentage dynamically instead of storing it
**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: Always reflects current state without synchronization issues
- **Single Source of Truth**: Derived from actual task statuses
- **Simplicity**: No need for complex update triggers or event handling
- **Reliability**: Cannot become inconsistent with underlying data

## Quality Assurance Patterns

### 10. Layered Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Implement unit tests for business logic and integration tests for APIs
**Rationale**:
- **Isolation**: Unit tests validate business rules without external dependencies
- **End-to-End Coverage**: Integration tests verify complete request/response cycles
- **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests run quickly for rapid development cycles
- **Confidence**: High test coverage (83%) ensures system reliability

### 11. Exception Handling Pattern
**Decision**: Implement custom exception hierarchy with centralized error handling
**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: Uniform error responses across all API endpoints
- **Separation**: Clear distinction between business and technical errors
- **Maintainability**: Centralized error handling logic
- **User Experience**: Meaningful error messages for API consumers

### 12. Input Validation at Boundaries
**Decision**: Validate all inputs at the API boundary using schemas
**Rationale**:
- **Security**: Prevent invalid data from entering the system
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting API contracts
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout the application
- **Early Failure**: Catch validation errors before business logic execution

## Security Patterns

### 13. Authentication/Authorization Strategy
**Decision**: Implement JWT-based stateless authentication
**Rationale**:
- **Scalability**: No server-side session storage required
- **Stateless**: Each request contains all necessary authentication information
- **Cross-Service**: Can be used across multiple microservices
- **Standard**: Industry-standard approach for API authentication

### 14. Password Security Pattern
**Decision**: Use cryptographic hashing with salt for password storage
**Rationale**:
- **Security**: Passwords are never stored in plain text
- **Protection**: Salt prevents rainbow table attacks
- **Industry Standard**: Following security best practices
- **Reversibility**: Passwords cannot be recovered, only reset

## Deployment and DevOps Patterns

### 15. Configuration Management Pattern
**Decision**: Use environment variables for all configuration
**Rationale**:
- **12-Factor App**: Follows industry best practices for cloud applications
- **Environment Separation**: Different configs for dev/test/prod
- **Security**: Secrets never stored in source code
- **Flexibility**: Runtime configuration without code changes

### 16. Containerization Strategy
**Decision**: Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: Same environment across development and production
- **Portability**: Runs anywhere Docker is supported
- **Efficiency**: Multi-stage builds reduce final image size
- **DevOps**: Easier deployment and scaling

## Code Quality Patterns

### 17. Static Analysis and Formatting
**Decision**: Automated code formatting and linting in development workflow
**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: Uniform code style across the entire codebase
- **Quality**: Early detection of potential issues
- **Productivity**: Reduces time spent on code review formatting discussions
- **Standards**: Enforces Python community best practices

### 18. Type Safety Pattern
**Decision**: Comprehensive type hints throughout the application
**Rationale**:
- **Documentation**: Code is self-documenting with type information
- **IDE Support**: Better autocompletion and refactoring tools
- **Error Prevention**: Catch type-related errors before runtime
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify code

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Scalability Patterns
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: For complex read/write operations
- **Event Sourcing**: If audit trails become more complex
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Message Queues**: For asynchronous processing

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Structured Logging**: For better log analysis
- **Metrics Collection**: Application performance monitoring
- **Distributed Tracing**: For request flow visualization
- **Health Checks**: For deployment and monitoring automation
